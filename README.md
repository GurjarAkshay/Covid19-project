## Project Info:
## Covid 19 has been adversely impacting our lives for a long time now. In this project, we will extract data from a JSON file containing various information like daily cases, deaths, recovery etc. for each State and union territory.
### We will use the data to gain some insight about covid 19 situation in India.
### **Insights we are looking for:** 
1. Dailly cases, recoverd, deaths, vaccinated, tested etc.
2. Performace of States and UTs on the above parameters on a time frame.
3. We will also deep dive and calculate Case Fatality Ratio and Test Positivity Ratio.
4. We will use these above parameters to compare States and UTs performances.
5. We will also compute the same parameters for Districts.
6. Finally we will plot some graphs to visualize these parameters.
